=====================================

A toolbox for despeckling SAR image written in OpenCL

Implemented Filters
-------------------

So far only the following filters are implemented:

* **Boxcar**: The simple boxcar filter for InSAR data
* **NLInSAR**: A nonlocal InSAR filter introduced in *Deledalle, C.-A.; Denis, L.; Tupin, F., "NL-InSAR: Nonlocal Interferogram Estimation," Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Transactions on , vol.49, no.4, pp.1441,1452, April 2011*
* **NLSAR work in progress**: A nonlocal filter for InSAR and PolSAR, introduced in *Deledalle, C.-A.; Denis, L.; Tupin, F.; Reigber, A.; JaÌˆger, M., "NL-SAR: A Unified Nonlocal Framework for Resolution-Preserving (Pol)(In)SAR Denoising," Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Transactions on , vol.53, no.4, pp.2021,2038, April 2015*
* **Goldstein**: The Goldstein InSAR filter, *Goldstein, R. M.; Werner, C. L., "Radar interferogram filtering for geophysical applications," Geophysical Research Letters,vol. 25, no. 21, pp.4035,4038, 1998*
