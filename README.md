Implemented Filters
-------------------

So far only InSAR filters are implemented:

### Boxcar
The simple boxcar filter

### NLInSAR
A nonlocal InSAR filter introduced in *Deledalle, C.-A.; Denis, L.; Tupin, F., "NL-InSAR: Nonlocal Interferogram Estimation," Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Transactions on , vol.49, no.4, pp.1441,1452, April 2011*

### NLSAR still WIP
A nonlocal filter for InSAR and PolSAR, introduced in *Deledalle, C.-A.; Denis, L.; Tupin, F.; Reigber, A.; JaÌˆger, M., "NL-SAR: A Unified Nonlocal Framework for Resolution-Preserving (Pol)(In)SAR Denoising," Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Transactions on , vol.53, no.4, pp.2021,2038, April 2015*
